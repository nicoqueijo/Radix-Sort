# RadixSort
Radix sort implementation in Java.

Problem #2:

(a) Implement (in Java) the RadixSort algorithm to sort in increasing order an array of
integer keys.

public void radixSort(int arr[])

In your implementation you must consider that each key contains only even digits (0, 2, 4,
6, and 8). Your program must detect the case of odd digits in the keys, and, in this case,
abort.

Note: To storage and process the bucket lists, use an ArrayList structure.

(b) What is the running time complexity of your radixSort method? Justify.
